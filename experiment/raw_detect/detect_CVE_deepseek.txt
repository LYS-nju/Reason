{Function: addMeByRC, Vulnerability Description: The function uses tx.origin for authorization instead of a proper access control modifier like onlyOwner. This could allow unauthorized contracts to be registered as RC (Reserved Contract) if the owner is tricked into interacting with a malicious contract, as tx.origin refers to the original transaction sender and can be exploited in phishing-like attacks. This bypasses intended access controls and could enable unauthorized calls to buyFromRC and claim functions.}
