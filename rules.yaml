- Name: Ether transfer
  Situation: Ether transfer operations, transfer(), send() and call()
  Suggestion: Ether transfers are considered AC risks only if unauthorized users can trigger them and affect critical state; protected transfers are safe.
  Few-shot:
    Code: Checks balance and contract state before transferring Ether.
    Reason: Transfer is guarded by business logic and access control, not an access control vulnerability.
    Code: Transfers Ether to an external address without any access control.
    Reason: Unrestricted external call, could be a potential access control vulnerability.

- Name: Fallback
  Situation: The contract's fallback function
  Suggestion: Fallback functions are considered risky only if they perform meaningful operations (state changes or external calls). Empty, event-only, or always-reverting functions do not introduce access control vulnerabilities.
  Few-shot:
    Code: |
      fallback() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        externalContract.call("");
      }
    Reason: Modifies state and calls external contracts without access control, creating potential vulnerability.
    Code: |
      fallback() external payable {
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
        revert("Direct payment not allowed");
      }
    Reason: Reverts immediately or only emits events, thus does not introduce access control vulnerabilities.

- Name: Selfdestruct
  Situation: Use of the selfdestruct(address) or suicide(address) instruction
  Suggestion: Ensure only the contract owner can execute self-destruction and verify proper access control.

- Name: Low-level Call
  Situation: call(), delegatecall() and staticcall()
  Suggestion: Carefully assess the context of these calls and determine if access restrictions are needed, as they are critical operations.

- Name: Misclassification of Constructor
  Situation: Any function that might be a constructor
  Suggestion: Carefully distinguish constructors from regular functions by considering the Solidity version, function name, and capitalization conventions.

- Name: Tx.origin
  Situation: Any place where tx.origin is used
  Suggestion: The tx.origin can be spoofed; any usage should be carefully evaluated for security implications.

- Name: Variable Initialization
  Situation: State variable is not initialized.
  Suggestion: Do not associate variable initialization issues with access control vulnerabilities.

- Name: Standard Token Management
  Few-shot:
    Code: |
      function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
        _balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        _balances[recipient] += amount;
        return true;
      }
      function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256) {
        return _allowances[owner][spender];
      }
      function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        _allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        return true;
      }
      function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(_balances[sender] >= amount);
        require(_allowances[sender][msg.sender] >= amount);
        _balances[sender] -= amount;
        _balances[recipient] += amount;
        _allowances[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;
        return true;
      }
      function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner)
        _totalSupply += amount;
        _balances[account] += amount;
      }
      function burn(uint256 amount) external {
        require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
        _balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        _totalSupply -= amount;
      }
    Reason: This is Standard token management; do not consider it an access control vulnerabilities.

- Name: Hypothesis
  Suggestion: Avoid making hypothetical or unsupported assumptions at any time.

# - Name: Gas Opti
#   Match: "Use of arrays, mappings and low-level calls."
#   Description: "Reasoning toward gas-related issue."
#   Suggestion: "Assess the upper bound of gas usage in smart contract."

# - Name: Critical Operations
#   Match: "The function includes critical operations that may lead to access control vulnerabilty."
#   Description: "Reasoning toward access control vulnerability."
#   Suggestion: "If access control vulnerability is suspected, carefully analyze whether there exists any path that can bypass the intended access control mechanisms."

# - Name: Arithmetic
#   Situation: "Outdated compiler versions and arithmetic operations (e.g., +, -, *, /)."
#   Description: "Reasoning toward arithmetic vulnerability, such as integer overflow/underflow."
#   Suggestion: "Check whether proper overflow protection mechanisms are implemented."
