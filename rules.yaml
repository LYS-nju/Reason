- Name: Ether transfer
  Situation: Ether transfer operations, transfer(), send() and call()
  Suggestion: Consider the context and focus on potential access control vulnerabilities rather than reentrancy issues

- Name: Fallback
  Situation: The contract's fallback function
  Suggestion: Carefully consider any subsequent operations triggered by Ether transfers in the fallback function

- Name: Selfdestruct
  Situation: Use of the selfdestruct(address) or suicide(address) instruction
  Suggestion: Ensure only the contract owner can execute self-destruction and verify proper access control.

- Name: Low-level Call
  Situation: call(), delegatecall() and staticcall()
  Suggestion: Carefully assess the context of these calls and determine if access restrictions are needed, as they are critical operations.

- Name: Hypothesis
  Suggestion: Avoid making hypothetical or unsupported assumptions at any time.

# - Name: Gas Opti
#   Match: "Use of arrays, mappings and low-level calls."
#   Description: "Reasoning toward gas-related issue."
#   Suggestion: "Assess the upper bound of gas usage in smart contract."

# - Name: Critical Operations
#   Match: "The function includes critical operations that may lead to access control vulnerabilty."
#   Description: "Reasoning toward access control vulnerability."
#   Suggestion: "If access control vulnerability is suspected, carefully analyze whether there exists any path that can bypass the intended access control mechanisms."

# - Name: Arithmetic
#   Situation: "Outdated compiler versions and arithmetic operations (e.g., +, -, *, /)."
#   Description: "Reasoning toward arithmetic vulnerability, such as integer overflow/underflow."
#   Suggestion: "Check whether proper overflow protection mechanisms are implemented."
