Let's analyze the given Solidity code for potential access control vulnerabilities:

1. **Contract Overview**: 
    - The contract `ValidatorWithdrawalVault` handles the distribution of rewards and settling of funds related to validator operations. It interacts with multiple external contracts and libraries to perform its tasks.
    - Functions `distributeRewards` and `settleFunds` seem to involve access control mechanisms that determine who can execute them.

2. **Function: `distributeRewards`**:
    - The function begins by extracting the poolId and validatorId from the `VaultProxy` contract and uses them to perform several operations.
    - It checks whether `msg.sender` has the operator role through `staderConfig.onlyOperatorRole(msg.sender)`. If `msg.sender` lacks the operator role, the function requires the rewards to be below a certain threshold to proceed.
    - If the conditions are not met, the function emits a failure event and reverts.

    **Access Control Analysis**:
    - The function is protected by the `onlyOperatorRole` check combined with a rewards threshold condition, which appears to be an appropriate control for determining eligibility to execute reward distribution.

3. **Function: `settleFunds`**:
    - This function retrieves poolId and validatorId from `VaultProxy` and ensures that `msg.sender` matches the node registry address.
    - If `msg.sender` is not the node registry contract, it reverts the transaction with an error.

    **Access Control Analysis**:
    - The function uses `msg.sender != nodeRegistry` as a gatekeeping mechanism to restrict access. This check ensures that only the node registry contract can call this function, which is a reasonable access control for the settle funds process.

4. **Other Functions and Internal Functions**:
    - Functions like `calculateValidatorWithdrawalShare`, `getCollateralETH`, `getOperatorAddress`, and `getUpdatedPenaltyAmount` are either view functions or internal utility functions that support the main functions. These do not require explicit access controls since they do not perform sensitive operations independently.

5. **Final Assessment**:
    - Both main functions, `distributeRewards` and `settleFunds`, employ access control checks to restrict function execution to entities with the proper roles or addresses.
    - No obvious access control vulnerabilities are detected based on the provided contract logic and existing checks.

Based on this analysis, the code does not appear to contain any access control vulnerabilities:
