To analyze the provided Solidity code for access control vulnerabilities, I will go through the functions and the contract setup step-by-step:

1. **Contract Overview**:
   - The `RemoteAddressValidator` contract implements the `IRemoteAddressValidator` interface and extends `Upgradable`.
   - The contract manages trusted addresses and chains, validating senders based on a stored hash.

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor initializes the immutable `interchainTokenServiceAddress` and `interchainTokenServiceAddressHash`.
   - There's a check to ensure `_interchainTokenServiceAddress` is not a zero address, which prevents a common initialization mistake.

3. **Access Control Mechanism**:
   - The contract uses `onlyOwner` modifiers for several functions: `addTrustedAddress`, `removeTrustedAddress`, `addGatewaySupportedChains`, and `removeGatewaySupportedChains`.
   - These modifiers imply that ownership is required to execute these functions, typically relying on the `Upgradable` contract to define the `onlyOwner` modifier.

4. **Functions with `onlyOwner` modifier**:
   - **`addTrustedAddress`:** Allows the owner to add a trusted address for a specific chain.
   - **`removeTrustedAddress`:** Allows the owner to remove a trusted address for a specific chain.
   - **`addGatewaySupportedChains`:** Allows the owner to add chains that are supported by the gateway.
   - **`removeGatewaySupportedChains`:** Allows the owner to remove chains from those supported by the gateway.

5. **Potential Vulnerabilities**:
   - Since the `onlyOwner` modifier is used in functions that modify critical mappings and data, ensuring that the modifier is correctly implemented in the inherited `Upgradable` contract is crucial.
   - If the `Upgradable` contract does not correctly enforce ownership checks, all functions protected by `onlyOwner` could be vulnerable to unauthorized access.
   - This analysis assumes that the `Upgradable` contract correctly implements access control for the `onlyOwner` modifier.

6. **Validation Logic**:
   - The `validateSender` function does not have access control restrictions, but it doesn't modify state; it only checks conditions against stored hashes.

Given the analysis, the focus is on the assumption that the `onlyOwner` modifier is correctly enforcing access control. Assuming it is, no access control vulnerabilities are detected within the `RemoteAddressValidator` contract itself.

**Conclusion**:

{No Access Control Vulnerabilities}
