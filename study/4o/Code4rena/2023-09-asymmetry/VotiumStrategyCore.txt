To analyze the provided Solidity code for access control vulnerabilities, let's go through the contract step by step and evaluate its access control mechanisms:

1. **Initial Setup and Modifiers**:
   - The contract uses the `OwnableUpgradeable` from OpenZeppelin, which provides basic owner-based access control with the `onlyOwner` modifier.
   - There's also a custom modifier `onlyRewarder` that restricts access to certain functions to the `rewarder` address.

2. **Functions with Access Control**:
   - `setChainlinkCvxEthFeed`: This function can only be called by the owner, as enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This is appropriate since changing the Chainlink price feed should be restricted to the contract owner.
   - `setRewarder`: This function is restricted to the owner, allowing the owner to set the `rewarder` address. This is appropriately controlled.
   - `claimRewards`: This function uses the `onlyRewarder` modifier, restricting its execution to the `rewarder`. This ensures that only the designated rewarder can claim rewards.
   - `depositRewards`: This function is publicly accessible and has no access control. It deals with depositing rewards, but since it's part of the reward distribution mechanism, it might be expected to be publicly accessible.
   - `withdrawStuckTokens`: This function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict token withdrawal operations to the owner, which is a sound practice.
   - `applyRewards`: This function uses the `onlyRewarder` modifier, ensuring that only the `rewarder` can apply rewards, maintaining consistency with the reward claim process.

3. **Potential Access Control Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Public Functions Without Access Control**:
     - The `depositRewards` function is public and does not have access control modifiers. This could potentially allow anyone to interact with the function in an undesired way, unless public access is intended for functionality reasons.

4. **Overall Access Control Assessment**:
   - The contract generally employs adequate access control measures using `onlyOwner` and `onlyRewarder` modifiers where needed. However, the lack of access control on `depositRewards` could be a concern if public access is not intentional.

Based on this analysis, here's the access control vulnerability detected:
