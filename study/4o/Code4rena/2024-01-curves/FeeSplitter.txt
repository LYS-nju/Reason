To analyze the given Solidity code for access control vulnerabilities, I will systematically examine the functions within the contract, focusing on how access control is implemented:

1. **Contract Overview**: 
   - The `FeeSplitter` contract inherits from a `Security` contract, which implies there might be access control mechanisms defined in the `Security` contract.
   - The contract includes several functions that interact with fees and token balances, such as `setCurves`, `addFees`, `onBalanceChange`, and `claimFees`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **setCurves(Curves curves_)**:
     - This function allows setting the `Curves` contract instance, which could potentially affect fee calculations and distributions. It lacks any access control modifiers. Any user can call this function, potentially changing critical contract settings.
   - **addFees(address token)**:
     - This function is protected by the `onlyManager` modifier, suggesting there is an access control mechanism to ensure that only the manager can add fees to the token.
   - **onBalanceChange(address token, address account)**:
     - This function is also protected by the `onlyManager` modifier, ensuring only the manager can call it.
   - **claimFees(address token)** and **batchClaiming(address[] calldata tokenList)**:
     - Both functions are callable by any external user, which makes sense as users should be able to claim their own fees. The functions do not need specific access control beyond ensuring the caller is the recipient of the claimed fees.

3. **Access Control Vulnerabilities**:
   - The primary issue lies with the `setCurves` function, which lacks any form of access control. Allowing any user to change the `Curves` contract instance can lead to unauthorized modifications, potentially affecting fee distribution or balance calculations across the entire contract.

Finally, the detected access control vulnerabilities are:

```json
[
    { "Function": "setCurves", "Vulnerability Description": "Lacks access control, allowing any user to change the Curves contract instance." }
]
```
