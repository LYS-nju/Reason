To analyze the code for access control vulnerabilities, let's break down the functions and modifiers used in the contract:

1. **Constructor**:
   - Initializes the contract with `_wethAddress`, `gasIsEth`, and `_executor`. The `Owned` contract ensures that the deployer is set as the owner. There is no apparent access control issue in the constructor.

2. **Modifiers**:
   - `onlyEthChain`: Ensures certain functions are called only when `gasCurrencyIsEth` is `true`.
   - `onlyLzApp`: Restricts access to functions where `dcntEth` is the caller.
   - `onlyIfWeHaveEnoughReserves`: Checks if the contract has enough WETH balance.
   - `userDepositing` and `userIsWithdrawing`: Manage the user's balance within the contract.
   - `onlyOwner`: Comes from the `Owned` contract and restricts function access to the contract owner.

3. **Functions with Access Control**:
   - `registerDcntEth`: Restricted to `onlyOwner`, so only the owner can set `dcntEth`.
   - `addDestinationBridge`: Restricted to `onlyOwner`, ensuring only the owner can set destination bridges.
   - `onOFTReceived`: Restricted to `onlyLzApp`, ensuring only `dcntEth` can call it.
   - `redeemEth` and `redeemWeth`: Use `onlyIfWeHaveEnoughReserves`, but this does not handle specific access control to prevent unauthorized user actions beyond checking reserves.
   - `addLiquidityEth`, `removeLiquidityEth`, `addLiquidityWeth`, `removeLiquidityWeth`: Use `userDepositing` and `userIsWithdrawing` to manage balances, along with `onlyEthChain` where applicable.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - Functions like `redeemEth` and `redeemWeth` rely on reserve checks but don't have any other restrictions, allowing any user to call them as long as reserves are sufficient. This isn't an access control vulnerability per se but could be problematic if reserve conditions are improperly managed.
   - The contract seems to lack comprehensive restrictions on who can interact with liquidity functions (`addLiquidityWeth`, `removeLiquidityWeth`, etc.). However, this might be intentional if the contract is designed to be open to all users.
   
Given this analysis, there appear to be no explicit access control vulnerabilities in the code, assuming intended functionality allows public access to liquidity management functions and relies on modifiers for security.
