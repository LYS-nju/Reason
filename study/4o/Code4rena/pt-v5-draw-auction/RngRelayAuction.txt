1. **Constructor Analysis**:
    - The constructor initializes critical state variables such as `prizePool`, `rngAuctionRelayer`, `_auctionDurationSeconds`, and `_auctionTargetTimeFraction`.
    - There is no explicit access control mechanism in the constructor itself, which is acceptable as constructors are only called once during contract deployment.

2. **External Functions Analysis**:
    - **`rngComplete`**:
        - This function can be called by any external address, as there is no `require` statement or modifier restricting access.
        - This function performs critical operations like updating `_auctionResults`, `_lastSequenceId`, closing draws in `prizePool`, and withdrawing reserves. These operations should be restricted to trusted addresses only, as they can affect the contract's state and rewards distribution.

    - **`computeRewards` and `computeRewardsWithTotal`**:
        - These functions are also externally callable without access control.
        - They return computed rewards based on the current state and provided auction results, but they do not change the state. Therefore, they do not need strict access control.

3. **View Functions**:
    - Functions such as `isSequenceCompleted`, `auctionDuration`, `computeRewardFraction`, `lastSequenceId`, and `getLastAuctionResult` are view functions and do not alter the contract state. These can be left unrestricted for public access since they only provide information.

4. **Internal Functions**:
    - Internal functions like `_computeRewards`, `_sequenceHasCompleted`, and `_fractionalReward` are correctly restricted to internal use only, preventing external access.

5. **Event Emissions**:
    - Events are emitted within `rngComplete` and are correctly used for logging actions within the contract.

6. **Overall Analysis**:
    - The critical function `rngComplete` lacks access control, which can lead to unauthorized operations affecting the reward distribution and sequence completion.
    - There should be a mechanism (such as an `onlyOwner` modifier or equivalent) to ensure that only authorized addresses can call `rngComplete`.

**Access Control Vulnerabilities Detected**:
- {Function: rngComplete, Vulnerability Description: Missing access control allows any external address to call `rngComplete`, potentially affecting reward distribution and sequence operations without restrictions.}
